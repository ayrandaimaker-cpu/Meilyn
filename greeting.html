      <p>
        February 3rd isn’t just a date.<br />
        It’s the day the world became a little softer for me — because you exist
        in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are my favorite thought in quiet moments,<br />
        my comfort on hard days,<br />
        and the smile I never get tired of chasing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loving you has been my favorite journey — in quiet moments, loud
        laughter, and everything in between.
